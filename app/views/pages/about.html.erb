      <p class="content-subtitle">I recently left a career in finance to pursue one in web development.  I learned a lot in finance and did well in different sales and service roles.   I made the change so I could use my skills in creativity and as well as develop new skills.  I enjoy seeing the things Iâ€™ve created make people smile and increase the quality of their lives.!</p>
