About Me

<div class='parallax-paragraphs'>
I recently left a career in finance to pursue one in web development.  I enjoyed finance and found a lot of success.  But realized all I was doing was selling products and not using any creative skills with my financial knowledge.  I made the change so I could be more creative in my work.  I believe being able to be creative in you job provides the most job satisfaction!

Apart from being creative, I also find joy in being active.  I like to hike, camp, and take my tacoma off-roading.  I especially enjoy playing sports and working out.  Basketball is by far my favorite thing in the world.  Ok, third after family and God, but it is a close third!
