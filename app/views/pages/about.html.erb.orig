        <p>I am 29 years old and recently left a career in finance.  I really enjoy watching and playing most sports, but primarily football and basketball.  I also enjoy camping, hiking, and taking my truck off road.  I chose development to use my creative skills.  I enjoy seeing the things I've created make people smile and increase the quality of their lives.</p>

I recently left a career in finance to pursue one in web development.  I enjoyed finance and found a lot of success.  But realized I had lost some creative skills I once had.  I made the change so I could redevolop those skills and gain new ones.  I believe being able to be creative in you job brings out the highest job satisfaction!
